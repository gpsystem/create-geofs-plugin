# `@geps/cgp-template-react`

`@geps/cgp-template-react` is a template used for `create-geofs-plugin`. When the template flag is set to `react`, this template is used.

This template contains everything a developer could need for starting a vanilla js plugin with a React UI. Projects bootstrapped with this template include webpack to bundle modules, babel to write modern code without worrying about browser support and compile jsx, as well as React built in.
