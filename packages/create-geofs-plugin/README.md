# Create GeoFS Plugin

> `create-geofs-plugin` is a _command line interface_ (CLI) for Node.js that generates a new plugin compatible with GeoFS Plugin System.

More specifically, this CLI allows you to select from our pre-defined blueprints to choose a basic working example to start from.

## Installation

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your workstation, then open your terminal and type the following command:

```sh
npx create-geofs-plugin my-first-app
```

and follow the instructions printed on the terminal as you go. create-geofs-plugin will then take care of the heavy lifting required to setup a plugin development environment, with proper folder structure, and even installing all the basic plugin dependencies.
